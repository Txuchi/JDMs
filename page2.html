	Initial D (頭文字イニシャルD, Inisharu Dī) is a Japanese seinen street racing manga by Shuichi Shigeno that ran from 1995 to 2013. 
	It was adapted into an eleven part anime series, beginning with Initial D (commonly known as First Stage) in 1998 and ending with Initial D Final Stage in 2014.
	The series also spawned several video games, including a series of arcade games by SEGA. In 2005 a Hong Kong live action adaptation film was released. 
	A trilogy of films known as New Initial D the Movie (or the Legends Trilogy) was released between 2014 and 2016. 
	It was followed with a sequel manga series known as MF Ghost in 2017, which was subsequently followed by an anime adaptation in 2023.
	</p>
	<p>
	Initial D has been adapted into several anime television and original video animations series by OB Studio Comet, Studio Gallop, Pastel, A.C.G.T and SynergySP. 
	A live action film by Avex and Media Asia was released in 2005. Both the manga and anime series were initially licensed for English-language distribution in North America by Tokyopop (2002–2009).
	However, the anime license has since been picked up by Funimation (now Crunchyroll), while the manga was relicensed by Kodansha USA in 2019.
	</p>
	<p>
	Set in the late 1990s in Japan's Gunma Prefecture, the series follows the adventures of Takumi Fujiwara, an eighteen year old who helps his father run a tofu store by making deliveries every morning 
	to a hotel on Akina with his father's Toyota Sprinter Trueno GT-APEX (AE86). It is revealed that Takumi has been driving on Mt. Akina every morning to deliver Tofu to the summit five years before he even had his license. 
	As a result his skills in mountain racing were honed, and is able to drive under adverse weather conditions.

		<h2> Story Arcs </h2>
		<p>
	Initial D is officially split into two main arcs, the Akina's Eight-Six Arc and the Project D Arc, known as Season One and Two in the French release.
	For the sake of making the series easier to break down, the Initial D Wiki splits these main arcs into six smaller arcs, three for each main arc. These are defined as:

		<h2> The White Ghost of Akina </h2>
		<p> The story begins when street racers called the Akagi RedSuns, a team from Mt. Akagi, come to challenge Mt. Akina's local team, the Akina SpeedStars, to a "friendly" race.
		After seeing how skilled the RedSuns are, the SpeedStars treat it as a race for pride, determined not to be humiliated on their home turf. 
		However, the SpeedStars are left in a bind when their team leader and primary downhill driver Iketani has an accident during a practice run.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		They were desperate for a replacement, until Iketani learns from Yuichi, the manager of the petrol station he is working in, that the fastest car on Akina's downhill 
		was a panda-colored AE86 owned by a Tofu store owner, and traces the car back to a local Tofu store. He discovers that the store's owner, Bunta Fujiwara, was a street racer of great 
		repute in his younger days known as the "Ghost of Akina". Iketani appeals to the older man to take his place in the race against the RedSuns. Iketani is confident that Bunta will 
		come to save the day. But when the race day comes, his son Takumi appears with his Trueno instead. Although at first reluctant to let Takumi race, Iketani relents after it is 
		revealed that he is actually the "Ghost of Akina," the one who outran Keisuke Takahashi while on one of his delivery runs. Takumi proceeds to defeat Keisuke and his Mazda RX-7 (FD3S), 
		causing considerable astonishment in the local racing community and putting an end to the RedSuns winning streak.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Despite being originally apathetic about the notion of racing, Takumi begins to grow more interested as he receives challenges from the Myogi NightKids, 
		and begins to understand the concept of a street racer's pride, culminating in the battle between him and Ryosuke Takahashi, the so-called "White Comet of Akagi." 
		Takumi handed Ryosuke his first defeat.
